# changepoints
Multivariate Bayesian changepoint analysis with regimes

For a demonstration of how the code works, run the jupyter notebook changepoint_simulation.ipynb.

Note that the commented lines:

#%pip install numpy

#%pip install scipy

#%pip install matplotlib

may need to be temporarily uncommented the first time the code is run, to install any needed packages.
